Step 1: The CIFAR-10 dataset is downloaded from the official website
Step 2: The dataset is decoded with the use of a Python script to see the actual images and 
use them.
Step 3: Two CNN models are built and one is a training model with the use of training 
dataset.
Step 4: The model is tested with the use of a test dataset and the performances of both 
models are evaluated and compared.

IMPLEMENTATION
 Software Details
In order to run CNN models, Python requires the following packages: 
• Tensorflow 1.7.0 
• Keras 2.1.5 
• Pickle (Python’s built-in package)
• NumPy 1.14.2 
• Matplolib 2.2.2
